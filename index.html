        <h2>Prosper Opara</h2>
        <h2>my friends call me Prospero</h2>
        <p> My Name is Prosper Opara I'm generally an optimistic person with a good sense of humor fairly easy going and I don't think I'm too critical about things, my hobbies are reading and learning new things  </p>
        <p>My Major is Applied Business Mgmt., I'm not married and do not have any kids reading all the Intros I think I'm the only one on here who's pursuing a business degree </p>
        <p>I'm from Nigeria and I live in Abuja Nigeria, I can't recall having problems with technology though I'm very new to coding, web development/design and computer programing, most times computer runs into a problem so I just learn the steps to fix them, I'm excited reading everyone's intro, learning computer and web could be fun and great I'm looking forward to learning a lot this semester</p>
